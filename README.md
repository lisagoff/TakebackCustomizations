# Takeback Customizations

This [Omeka](http://omeka.org) plugin holds sundry customizations for
the [Take Back the Archive Project](http://takeback.scholarslab.org).
Currently, it does the following:

* Sorts the Item records on the DC:Date field, in ascending order, by
  default, instead of the the record was added to the archive.

## Someday/Maybe

* Filter any output of Tags to only display a predetermined subset of
  tags.
* Order collections by the number of Items each collection holds *or* by
  DC:Title, instead of the `date_added` column.
